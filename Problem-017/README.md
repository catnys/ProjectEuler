# Project Euler - Problem 17

# `Number Letter Counts`

## Description

If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.

If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?

**Note:** Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters, and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.

## Example

For the range 1 to 5:
- 1 is written as "one" and has 3 letters
- 2 is written as "two" and has 3 letters
- 3 is written as "three" and has 5 letters
- 4 is written as "four" and has 4 letters
- 5 is written as "five" and has 4 letters

Therefore, the total number of letters is 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19.
