# Project Euler - Problem 46

## `Goldbach's Other Conjecture`

### Problem Statement

It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

9 = 7 + 2×1²
15 = 7 + 2×2²
21 = 3 + 2×3²
25 = 7 + 2×3²
27 = 19 + 2×2²
33 = 31 + 2×1²

It turns out that the conjecture is false.

What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?

### Instructions

1. Generate odd composite numbers.
2. For each odd composite number, check if it can be expressed as the sum of a prime and twice a square.
3. Identify the smallest number that does not satisfy the condition.
4. Output the result.

### Example

The odd composite number 9 can be written as 7 + 2×1². You need to find the smallest odd composite that cannot be expressed in this way.

### Discussion

This problem involves generating composite numbers, checking for prime sums, and performing calculations with squares. Efficient prime checking and the generation of composite numbers are crucial for solving the problem.
