This repository contains my solutions to the problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), implemented in C++, and now also in Rust. Project Euler is a collection of challenging computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs.

## About Project Euler

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. The problems are designed to be solved programmatically and are a great way to improve your algorithmic and problem-solving skills.

Visit the official Project Euler website: [https://projecteuler.net/](https://projecteuler.net/)

## Getting Started

To run and test the solutions in this repository, you will need a C++ compiler and/or Rust toolchain installed on your machine. The solutions are organized by problem number in their respective folders.

### Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (e.g., [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)) for compiling C++ files.
- [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for compiling and running Rust files.


### Running a Solution

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/catnys/ProjectEuler.git
```

Navigate to the problem you want to run (replace X with the specific problem number):

```bash
cd ProjectEuler/Problem-X
```

#### For C++

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o main
./main
```

#### For Rust

If a Rust solution exists (e.g., `main.rs`):

```bash
rustc main.rs -o main
./main
```

## Solutions
The solutions are implemented in C++ and Rust (and maybe more in the future!). Each problem has its own folder named Problem-X, where X is the problem number. C++ solutions are in `main.cpp` and Rust solutions will be in `main.rs` (or similar).

Note: Solutions may contain spoilers, so it's recommended to attempt solving the problems on your own before referring to the solutions.

## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute additional solutions or improvements to existing ones, please follow these guidelines:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature: git checkout -b feature-name.
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add new solution for ProblemX'`.
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature-name`.
5. Submit a pull request, hopefully i'll see u around :3
