# Project Euler - Problem 12

## `Highly Divisible Triangular Number`

### Problem Statement

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28\). The first ten terms would be:

\[1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, \ldots\]

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

- \(1: 1\)
- \(3: 1, 3\)
- \(6: 1, 2, 3, 6\)
- \(10: 1, 2, 5, 10\)
- \(15: 1, 3, 5, 15\)
- \(21: 1, 3, 7, 21\)
- \(28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28\)

We can see that \(28\) is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

### Instructions

1. Find the first triangle number that has over five hundred divisors.
2. Provide the solution without revealing the code implementation.
3. If you choose to share your solution, avoid posting the code on public forums or repositories.
4. Reflect on the approach you took to solve the problem.

### Example

For the first seven triangle numbers:
- \(1\): Divisors - \(1\) (1 divisor)
- \(3\): Divisors - \(1, 3\) (2 divisors)
- \(6\): Divisors - \(1, 2, 3, 6\) (4 divisors)
- \(10\): Divisors - \(1, 2, 5, 10\) (4 divisors)
- \(15\): Divisors - \(1, 3, 5, 15\) (4 divisors)
- \(21\): Divisors - \(1, 3, 7, 21\) (4 divisors)
- \(28\): Divisors - \(1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28\) (6 divisors)

The first triangle number to have over five divisors is \(28\).

### Discussion

This problem involves finding the first triangle number that has over five hundred divisors. Consider efficient ways to calculate the divisors of a number and generate triangle numbers.
