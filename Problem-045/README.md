## `Triangular, Pentagonal, and Hexagonal`

### Problem Statement

Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulas:

- Triangle numbers: T(n) = n(n + 1) / 2 
- Pentagonal numbers: P(n) = n(3n − 1) / 2 
- Hexagonal numbers: H(n) = n(2n − 1)

It can be verified that T(285) = P(165) = H(143) = 40755.

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal after 40755.

### Instructions

1. Generate triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers using the respective formulas.
2. Check for numbers that are common to all three sequences.
3. Find the next common number after 40755.
4. Output the result.

### Example

The number 40755 is the first number that is triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal. You need to find the next such number.

### Discussion

This problem requires generating numbers from three different sequences and checking for intersections between them. Efficiently finding the next common number involves iterating through each sequence and comparing values as they are generated.
