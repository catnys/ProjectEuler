## `Cyclical Figurate Numbers`

### Problem Statement

Triangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, and octagonal numbers are all figurate numbers and are generated by the following formulae:

- Triangle: T(n) = n(n + 1)/2
- Square: S(n) = n²
- Pentagonal: P(n) = n(3n − 1)/2
- Hexagonal: H(n) = n(2n − 1)
- Heptagonal: He(n) = n(5n − 3)/2
- Octagonal: O(n) = n(3n − 2)

The ordered set of three 4-digit numbers: 8128, 2882, 8281, has three interesting properties:

1. The set is cyclic, in that the last two digits of each number is the first two digits of the next number (including the last number with the first).
2. Each polygonal type: triangle (T), square (S), and pentagonal (P), is represented by a different number in the set.
3. This is the only set of 4-digit numbers with this property.

Find the sum of the only ordered set of six cyclic 4-digit numbers for which each polygonal type: triangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, and octagonal, is represented by a different number in the set.

### Instructions

1. Generate 4-digit numbers for each of the six polygonal types.
2. Identify sets of six cyclic numbers where each number belongs to a different polygonal type.
3. Find the sum of the numbers in the only set that meets the condition.
4. Output the result.

### Example

For the set 8128, 2882, and 8281, the numbers are cyclic, and each comes from a different polygonal type.

### Discussion

This problem involves generating figurate numbers and finding cyclic relationships between them. Efficiently handling sets of numbers and checking for cyclic properties are key to solving the problem.
