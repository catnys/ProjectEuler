# Project Euler - Problem 24

## `Lexicographic permutations`

### Problem Statement

A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, 3124 is one possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4. If all of the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order. The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1, and 2 are:

012   021   102   120   201   210

What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9?

### Instructions

1. Determine the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0 through 9.
2. Avoid revealing the code implementation if you decide to share your solution.
3. Reflect on the approach used to calculate the lexicographic permutation.
4. Consider strategies to optimize the solution for larger permutations.

### Example

For the digits 0, 1, and 2, the lexicographic permutations are:
- 012   021   102   120   201   210

The millionth lexicographic permutation for digits 0 through 9 is the solution to the problem.

### Discussion

This problem involves generating permutations in lexicographic order and identifying the millionth permutation. Consider efficient algorithms to compute permutations without exhaustively listing all possibilities.
