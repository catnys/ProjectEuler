# Project Euler - Problem 13

## `Large Sum`

### Problem Statement

Work out the first ten digits of the sum of the following one-hundred 50-digit numbers.

[Here, insert the list of 100 fifty-digit numbers provided in the problem statement on the Project Euler website.]

### Instructions

1. Calculate the sum of the provided one-hundred 50-digit numbers.
2. Output the first ten digits of this sum.

### Example

If the numbers were "12345678901234567890" and "09876543210987654321", their sum would be "22222222112222222211". The first ten digits of this sum are "2222222211".

### Discussion

This problem challenges participants to handle very large numbers, which exceed the typical integer size limit in many programming languages. It requires understanding how to perform arithmetic operations on such large numbers, either through built-in libraries for handling big integers or implementing custom algorithms for addition.

### Notes

The main difficulty lies in the sheer size of the numbers involved, necessitating careful consideration of numerical computation limits and potentially exploring arbitrary-precision arithmetic capabilities of the chosen programming language.
