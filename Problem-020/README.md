# Project Euler - Problem 20
## Description

n! means n × (n − 1) × ... × 3 × 2 × 1

For example, 10! = 10 × 9 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3628800,
and the sum of the digits in the number 10! is 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27.

Find the sum of the digits in the number N!.

## Example

For N = 10:
- The factorial of 10 is 10! = 3628800.
- The sum of the digits in 10! is 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27.

Therefore, the sum of the digits in 10! is 27.

## Run the Code

To solve the problem, you can use a programming language of your choice and create a script or program to calculate the factorial of N and then sum its digits.
