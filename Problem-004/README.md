## `Largest Palindrome Product`

### Problem Statement

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

### Instructions

1. Generate all products of two 3-digit numbers.
2. Identify palindromic numbers among these products.
3. Find the largest palindrome.
4. Output the result.

### Example

For the product of two 2-digit numbers (from 10 to 99), the largest palindrome is 9009 = 91 × 99.

### Discussion

This problem involves iterating through all possible products of two 3-digit numbers and checking if they form palindromic numbers. An efficient algorithm can be implemented to find the solution without iterating through all possible products.
