# Project Euler - Problem 22: Names Scores

## Problem Description

The aim of this problem is to sort a list of names alphabetically, then calculate a "name score" for each name in the list, where each letter of a name is assigned a value according to its position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26). The name score for each name is then calculated by multiplying the sum of the alphabetical values of each letter in the name by its position in the sorted list. Finally, the sum of all name scores is calculated.

**Objective:** Find the sum of all name scores for a given list of names.
